# easybuild(7) -- software build and installation framework.

## SYNOPSIS

EasyBuild is a software build and installation framework that allows
you to manage (scientific) software on High Performance Computing
(HPC) systems in an efficient way. It is motivated by the need for a
tool that combines the following features:

 * a flexible framework for building/installing (scientific) software
 * fully automates software builds
 * divert from the standard configure / make / make install with custom procedures
 * allows for easily reproducing previous builds
 * keep the software build recipes/specifications simple and human-readable
 * supports co-existence of versions/builds via dedicated installation prefix and module files
 * enables sharing with the HPC community (win-win situation)
 * automagic dependency resolution
 * retain logs for traceability of the build processes

## ENVIRONMENT CREATION
