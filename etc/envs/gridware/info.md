# gridware(7) -- Tool for installing and managing curated scientific applications and libraries.

## SYNOPSIS

Flight Gridware provides access to a curated collection of scientific
applications and libraries ready to install on your HPC environment,
ensuring you've got absolutely everything you need and allowing your
analysis to start as quickly as possible.

Covering many fields of scientific research, from fluid dynamics to
molecular dynamics, bioinformatics to statistics, machine learning to
electron microscopy, Gridware provides a comprehensive research
toolkit.

Gridware allows you to install from a selection of preconfigured
software depots providing quick batch deployment of groups of popular
applications, or the freedom to install your own selection of key
applications -- with all dependencies satisfied and appearing
automatically alongside your selections.

From the installation of multiple versions of the same application to
building your own architecture- and environment-optimized software,
Gridware has got you covered. And for those who want to get started
quickly you can install many applications from one of our prebuilt
binary repositories.

## ENVIRONMENT CREATION
