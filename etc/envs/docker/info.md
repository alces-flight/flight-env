# docker(7) -- Container platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

## SYNOPSIS

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running
applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from
your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker,
you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your
applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for
shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly
reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
